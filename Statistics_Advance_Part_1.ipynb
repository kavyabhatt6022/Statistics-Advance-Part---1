        "- Z-scores are used to compare data points from different distributions by standardizing them. By converting a raw score from any normal distribution into a Z-score, you are essentially expressing that score in terms of how many standard deviations it is away from its mean. This allows you to compare values that might have originated from datasets with vastly different means and standard deviations on a common scale. For example, you can compare a student's test score in a class with an average of 70 and standard deviation of 10 to a test score in another class with an average of 85 and a standard deviation of 5, by converting both scores to Z-scores. The score with the higher Z-score is relatively better within its respective distribution.\n"

        "\n",
        " 1.  **Independence:** The samples must be independent. This means that the outcome of one sample does not influence the outcome of another.\n",
        " 2.  **Random Sampling:** The samples must be drawn randomly from the population. This ensures that each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample.\n",
        " 3.  **Sample Size:** The sample size should be sufficiently large. While there's no strict rule, a general guideline is that a sample size of n ≥ 30 is often considered large enough for the CLT to hold reasonably well. For populations with distributions very different from normal, a larger sample size may be needed.\n",
        " 4.  **Population Distribution (less a strict assumption for the *theorem*, but impacts *when* it's useful):** The CLT applies regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. However, if the original population is already normally distributed, the distribution of sample means will be normal for *any* sample size (not just large ones). The power of the CLT is that it allows us to work with sample means from non-normal populations."
